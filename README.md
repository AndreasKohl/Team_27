**Anti-Covid-App** 


# INTRODUCTION

Anti-Covid-App is a mobile application which carries your Corona-Test information in form of a QR code and helps with fighting the pandemic.

The app provides functionality to create users profile with their personal informations, which is verified either with ID card or it is validated in person by specific institutions. 
It is advised that we all, as citizens, should test ourselves as much as possible. Following those advices , the users will have opportunity to hold all their test results inside of one app.
Based on type of the test ( pharmacy, PCR, antigen…) the specific QR code will be created which is valid for some period of time ( PCR test is valid for next 72 hours, pharmacy for 48 hours). If the user is vaccinated, permanent QR code will be generated. 
In case of a positive test, users will be notified with further informations about quarantine and they will be able to list all the contacts they had.
This app also provides users with official institutions rules and changes about current situation ( overall corona situation in the country, statistics, new infections, number of tests, travelling information, general information about the things you can do and the things which are prohibited by the government). No fake news, just official!
